# Aeroflow Brake Cooler 🏍️📊


<h1>Optimizing Brake Cooling Efficiency Using Carbon Fiber & CFD Simulations</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The Aeroflow Brake Cooler is a lightweight, high-efficiency cooling system designed to enhance brake performance by improving heat dissipation around the caliper. This project integrates advanced composite materials (carbon fiber & fiberglass) and Airflow Calculation to ensure optimal airflow distribution, reducing brake fade and extending component lifespan.<br />

<h2>Key Features</h2>

- <b>✅ Lightweight Design – Built using carbon fiber composite, reducing overall weight while maintaining structural integrity.</b>
  
- <b>✅ Optimized Airflow – Engineered through Airflow Calculation to ensure maximum cooling efficiency.</b>

- <b>✅ 3D Printing for Prototyping – Utilized additive manufacturing to create a functional prototype before full-scale production.<b>

- <b>✅ Improved Heat Dissipation – Designed to direct airflow precisely onto the brake caliper and have 2 inlet, minimizing heat buildup.<b>

- <b>✅ Durability & High-Temperature Resistance – Material selection ensures resistance to extreme braking conditions.</b> 

<h2>Development Process</h2>

- <b>1️⃣ Conceptual Design – Initial sketches and CAD modeling using SolidWorks & Fusion 360.<b>
 
- <b>2️⃣ CFD Analysis – Simulated airflow behavior using ANSYS Fluent and maximalize the airflow calculation to maximize cooling performance.<b>

- <b>3️⃣ Material Selection – Evaluated carbon fiber vs. fiberglass for optimal strength-to-weight ratio.<b>

- <b>4️⃣ Prototyping & Testing – Created a 3D-printed prototype for fitment and aerodynamics testing.<b>

- <b>5️⃣ Final Manufacturing – Implemented composite layering techniques for real-world application.<b>
